 * One of the most common uses of interfaces in languages like C# and Java, that of explicitly 
 * enforcing that a class meets a particular contract, is also possible in TypeScript.

/**
 * Interfaces describe the public side of the class, rather than both the public and private side. 
 * This prohibits you from using them to check that a class also has particular types for the 
 * private side of the class instance.
 * 
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Difference between the static and instance sides of classes
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * When working with classes and interfaces, it helps to keep in mind that a class has two types: 
 * the type of the static side and the type of the instance side. You may notice that if you create 
 * an interface with a construct signature and try to create a class that implements this interface 
 * you get an error:
 * 
 *      interface ClockConstructor {
 *          new (hour: number, minute: number);
 *      }
 * 
 *      class Clock implements ClockConstructor {
 *          currentTime: Date;
 *          constructor(h: number, m: number);
 *      }
 * 
 * This is because when a class implements an interface, only the instance side of the class is 
 * checked. Since the constructor sits in the static side, it is not included in this check.
 * 
 * Instead, you would need to work with the static side of the class directly. In this example, 
 * we define two interfaces, ClockConstructor for the constructor and ClockInterface for the 
 * instance methods. Then for convenience we define a constructor function createClock that 
 * creates instances of the type that is passed to it.

/**
 * Because createClockâ€™s first parameter is of type ClockConstructor, in 
 * createClock(AnalogClock, 7, 32), it checks that AnalogClock has the correct constructor signature.
 * 
 * ---------------------
 * Extending Interfaces
 * ---------------------
 * Like classes, interfaces can extend each other. This allows you to copy the members of one 
 * interface into another, which gives you more flexibility in how you separate your interfaces 
 * into reusable components.
